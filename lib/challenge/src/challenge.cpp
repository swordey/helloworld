/* 
* Hello there,
* In each challenge, you only have to edit the lib/challenge/challenge.h file to have the 
* correct solution. The solutions will be tested through unittests, that you can trigger 
* with the test feature of PlatformIO.
*
* You have two options to test your code:
* * Use the remote board, that is provided for the challenge, then you should use the PlatformIO: remote test
*     option, as you learned in the startup_env challenge.
* * Use your own board. You need to edit the platformio.ini file, then use the PlatformIO: Test feature
*
* INFO: to use our remote boards, you need to subscribe on our webpage.
*/

/*
* The tests will only be available if you provide the correct challengeCode.
* At each challenge, you will receive a challenge code, that is needed for the
* next challenge to test your code. Until you don't provide it, the tests will fail.
*
* For the hello world challenge, we provide you the challengeCode, but for the first 
* challenge, you will need to solve this challenge to get the code at the end.
* The code for the first challenge is the following:
*           (z7r<!w5'jm!wCPtESX\\jkZ@A2x6[:9M
